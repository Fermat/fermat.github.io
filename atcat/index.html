        Title: <em>Group actions on categories and their fixed points</em><br>
	<p>
	  Abstract:<br>
          Actions of a group on a set can be categorified to actions of a
          group on a category. The fixed point set becomes a fixed point category. I
          will give examples coming from representation theory, topology and physics.
          If time permits, I will sketch a generalization to actions of 2-groups on
          2-categories.

        Title: <em>Totally Distributive Categories</em><br>
	<p>
	  Abstract:<br>
          A  distributive law, in the sense of JM Beck, of a monad $M$ over a monad $A$, is a
          2-cell
          $MA \to AM$, subject to some equations ensuring precisely that the composite $AM$
          carries
          an obvious monad structure depending on the structures of $M$ and of $A$. The
          notion is not symmetric in $M$ and $A$. In particular, an object $k$ carries an
          $AM$-algebra structure if and only if $k$ carries an $A$-algebra structure $a:Ak \to k$;
          $k$ carries an $M$-algebra ​structure $m:Mk \to k$; and $a:Ak \to k$ is a homomorphism of
          $M$-algebras. <br> <br>

          These very general ideas are applicable to 2-monads on the 2-category $\mathrm{CAT}$,
          whereon some
          monads, known as KZ-monads, have the property that structures are left adjoint
          to units, while other monads, known as coKZ-monads, have the property that
          structures are right adjoint to units. It follows that a category $K$ either
          carries a [co]KZ-structure or it doesn't.
          In broad strokes, the algebras for a KZ-monad $A$ [coKZ-monad $M$] are categories
          having certain colimits, we could call them $A$-colimits [certain limits, we
          could call them $M$-limits].
          If there is a distributive law $MA \to AM$ (there either is one or there isn't
          one) then a category
          $K$ is an $AM$-algebra iff $K$ has $A$-colimits; $K$ has $M$-limits; and $AK \to K$ (left
          adjoint to the unit $K \to AK$) preserves $M$-limits. Preservation of $M$-limits by
          $AK \to K$ provides the definition of
          "$M$-limits distribute over $A$-colimits". <br> <br>

          In other broad strokes, the KZ-monads live in the construction $K \mapsto \mathrm{CAT}(K^
          {\mathrm{op}},\mathbf{Set})$ and the coKZ-monads live in the construction $K \mapsto \mathrm{CAT}(K,\mathbf{Set})^{\mathrm{op}}$.
          These constructions are not monads on $\mathrm{CAT}$. However, a locally small category $K$
          is said to be total(ly cocomplete) if the Yoneda functor $Y \to \mathrm{CAT}(K^{\mathrm{op}}, \mathbf{Set})$
          has a left adjoint $X$ and totally distributive if there is an $F \dashv X \dashv Y$. The point
          of these talks is to explain why totally distributive categories warrant the
          name, given the orthodoxy of the first two paragraphs, and reach towards a
          characterization of such. By the way, for any small category $S$, $\mathbf{Set}^{S^{\mathrm{op}}}$ is
          totally distributive but $({\mathbf{Set}^S})^{\mathrm{op}}$, while total, is not totally
          distributive.
