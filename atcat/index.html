	Title: <em> Monoidal Closed but not Compact Closed </em><br>
	<p>
	Abstract:<br>
	Every compact closed category is monoidal closed where the internal-hom is given as $A \multimap B = A^* \otimes B$. In the special case of self-dual compact closed category, where every object is its own dual $A^* = A$, then we have that the internal-hom is precisely the tensor product $A \multimap B = A \otimes B$. However, is the converse true? Starting with a symmetric monoidal category X such that $A \multimap B = A \otimes B$, is X compact closed? At first glance this seems like this might be true... But if one tries to prove the snake equations, one runs into troubles! So the answer is more likely no... but what's the counter-example? Unfortunately, no one seems to have a natural counter-example...

	  In this talk, I'll discuss this odd problem in more detail and hopefully someone smarter than me in the audience will come up with a counter-example.

	  This will be an easy and relaxed talk to start the term, so everyone should be able to follow along!

	Title: <em>Combining Bunched Type Theory with Dependent Types</em><br>
	<p>
	  Abstract:<br>
	  Categories of interest often have more than one monoidal closed
	  structure, and "bunched type theories" have been developed to capture
	  this situation. In this talk, I will present a novel combination of
	  bunched type theory with dependent types, giving a much more
	  expressive theory. Every type will have both a linear and non-linear
	  aspect, and the various type formers interact with both aspects. The
	  motivation for this work was to find a way to formalise arguments from
	  stable homotopy theory in type theory, but we also anticipate
	  applications to the theory of quantum programming languages.

	Title: <em>Improvements to 'Double Categories of Relations'</em><br>
	<p>
	  Abstract:<br>
	  In this talk I'll discuss how the overabundance of axioms in
	  my previous characterization of double categories of
	  relations (ACT 2021) can be cut down to a manageable number.

	Title: <em>Categorified algebraic closure</em><br>
	<p>
	  Abstract:<br>
	  A famous theorem of Deligne's says that any
	  (abelian, $\mathbb{C}$-linear) symmetric monoidal category satisfying certain mild size constraints
	  admits a symmetric monoidal functor to the category sVec of super vector spaces.
	  Deligne used this result to classify such symmetric monoidal categories in terms of representation
	  theories of algebraic groups — this is the "Tannakian Duality". A few years ago, I pointed out that
	  Deligne's theorem has a neat interpretation: it says that the symmetric monoidal category sVec
	  is the "algebraic closure" of the symmetric monoidal category Vec of vector spaces;
	  that the extension Vec $\subset$ sVec is "Galois"; and
	  that the Tannakian Duality is a categorified version of the Galois correspondence.
	  In this talk, I will explain the statement of Deligne's theorem and my interpretation, and mention some aspects of Deligne's proof.

        Title: <em>Double Fibrations (or functors are categories)</em><br>
        Joint work with Geoff Cruttwell, Michael Lambert, and Dorette Pronk<br>
        <p>
	  Abstract:<br>
          I will give the definition of a double fibration as a (pseudo) category
          object in the 2-category of fibrations of categories whose source and
          target are cleavage-preserving. I will show how, much like functors are
          category objects in an arrow category, double fibrations correspond
          to (strict) double functors between (pseudo) double categories that
          satisfy some properties. We have shown that these properties are
          precisely the ones making the double functor an internal fibration
          in the 2-category of double categories. We have also shown
          a "Grothendieck construction theorem", that is an equivalence of
          categories between double fibrations and indexed double categories. The
          latter are given by a type of lax functor D --> Span(Cat) from a
          double category D, where Span(Cat) is a 3-dimensional structure that
          we call a double 2-category. Two examples that are unified by the theory
          of double fibrations can also help to understand it, so we will look at
          them. One is that (as the name indicates) ours is the non-discrete
          case of [1], where the Grothendieck construction is that given by
          Bob Paré in [2] for a lax functor D --> Span(Set) between double
          categories. Also, seeing monoids as 1-object categories, we can recover
          the results for monoidal fibrations and monoidal indexed categories
          [3,4]. Being 3-dimensional, this is all a bit "wild" so I don't plan to
          give the full details, but I hope to still be able to convey "why"
          Span(Cat) is the receiving structure here that makes things work.<br><br>

        Title: <em>Enriched structure-semantics adjunctions and monad-theory equivalences for subcategories of arities
        </em><br>
        Joint work with Rory Lucyshyn-Wright<br>
        <p>
	  Abstract:<br>
          Several structure-semantics adjunctions and monad-theory equivalences
          have been established in category theory. Lawvere developed a
          structure-semantics adjunction between Lawvere theories and tractable
          Set-valued functors, which was subsequently generalized by Linton,
          while Dubuc established a structure-semantics adjunction between
          V-theories and tractable V-valued V-functors for a symmetric
          monoidal closed category V. It is also well known (and due to Linton)
          that there is an equivalence between Lawvere theories and finitary
          monads on Set. Generalizing this result, Lucyshyn-Wright (2016)
          established a monad-theory equivalence for eleutheric systems of arities
          in arbitrary closed categories. Building on earlier work by Nishizawa
          and Power, Bourke and Garner (2019) subsequently proved a general
          monad-theory equivalence for arbitrary small subcategories of arities
          in locally presentable enriched categories. However, neither of these
          equivalences generalizes the other, and there has not yet been a general
          treatment of enriched structure-semantics adjunctions that specializes
          to those established by Lawvere, Linton, and Dubuc. <br> <br>

          Motivated by these considerations, we develop a general framework for
          studying enriched structure-semantics adjunctions and monad-theory
          equivalences for subcategories of arities, which generalizes all
          of the aforementioned results and also provides new ones. For
          a subcategory of arities J in a V-category C over a
          symmetric monoidal closed category V, Linton’s notion of clone
          generalizes to provide enriched notions of J-theory and J-pretheory,
          which were also employed by Bourke and Garner (2019).
          We say that J is amenable if every J-theory admits free algebras,
          and is strongly amenable if every J-pretheory admits free algebras.
          If J is amenable, then we obtain an idempotent structure-semantics
          adjunction between certain J-pretheories and J-tractable V-categories
          over C, which yields an equivalence between J-theories and
          J-nervous V-monads on C. If J is strongly amenable, then
          we also obtain a rich theory of presentations for J-theories and
          J-nervous V-monads. We show that many previously studied
          subcategories of arities are (strongly) amenable, from which
          we recover the aforementioned structure-semantics adjunctions and
          monad-theory equivalences. We conclude with the result that any
          small subcategory of arities in a locally bounded closed
          category is strongly amenable, from which we obtain structure-semantics
          adjunctions and monad-theory equivalences in (e.g.) many
          convenient categories of spaces.

        Title: <em>Algebraic geometry and Tangent categories</em><br>
	<p>
	  Abstract:<br>
          Tangent categories axiomatize the existence of a "tangent
          bundle" endofunctor on a category. The canonical example is the category
          of smooth manifolds, but many other examples exist, including some
          recent examples from functor calculus. <br> <br>

          In this series of two talks, I'll describe a tangent category structure
          in algebraic geometry (specifically, on the category of affine schemes)
          and explain why I think it's interesting. <br> <br>

          The first talk will be introductory: I'll introduce/review tangent
          categories and affine schemes, and then look at the tangent category
          structure of affine schemes.  In the second talk, we'll see how concepts
          you can define in any tangent category (such as vector fields,
          differential bundles, and connections) apply to this particular
          example, and how these concepts relate to existing notions in algebraic geometry.<br><br>

          This talk is based on joint work with JS Lemay.
