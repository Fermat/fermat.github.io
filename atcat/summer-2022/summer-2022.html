        Title: <em>Group actions on categories and their fixed points</em><br>
	<p>
	  Abstract:<br>
          Actions of a group on a set can be categorified to actions of a
          group on a category. The fixed point set becomes a fixed point category. I
          will give examples coming from representation theory, topology and physics.
          If time permits, I will sketch a generalization to actions of 2-groups on
          2-categories.

        Title: <em>Totally Distributive Categories</em><br>
	<p>
	  Abstract:<br>
          A  distributive law, in the sense of JM Beck, of a monad $M$ over a monad $A$, is a
          2-cell
          $MA \to AM$, subject to some equations ensuring precisely that the composite $AM$
          carries
          an obvious monad structure depending on the structures of $M$ and of $A$. The
          notion is not symmetric in $M$ and $A$. In particular, an object $k$ carries an
          $AM$-algebra structure if and only if $k$ carries an $A$-algebra structure $a:Ak \to k$;
          $k$ carries an $M$-algebra â€‹structure $m:Mk \to k$; and $a:Ak \to k$ is a homomorphism of
          $M$-algebras. <br> <br>

          These very general ideas are applicable to 2-monads on the 2-category $\mathrm{CAT}$,
          whereon some
          monads, known as KZ-monads, have the property that structures are left adjoint
          to units, while other monads, known as coKZ-monads, have the property that
          structures are right adjoint to units. It follows that a category $K$ either
          carries a [co]KZ-structure or it doesn't.
          In broad strokes, the algebras for a KZ-monad $A$ [coKZ-monad $M$] are categories
          having certain colimits, we could call them $A$-colimits [certain limits, we
          could call them $M$-limits].
          If there is a distributive law $MA \to AM$ (there either is one or there isn't
          one) then a category
          $K$ is an $AM$-algebra iff $K$ has $A$-colimits; $K$ has $M$-limits; and $AK \to K$ (left
          adjoint to the unit $K \to AK$) preserves $M$-limits. Preservation of $M$-limits by
          $AK \to K$ provides the definition of
          "$M$-limits distribute over $A$-colimits". <br> <br>

          In other broad strokes, the KZ-monads live in the construction $K \mapsto \mathrm{CAT}(K^
          {\mathrm{op}},\mathbf{Set})$ and the coKZ-monads live in the construction $K \mapsto \mathrm{CAT}(K,\mathbf{Set})^{\mathrm{op}}$.
          These constructions are not monads on $\mathrm{CAT}$. However, a locally small category $K$
          is said to be total(ly cocomplete) if the Yoneda functor $Y \to \mathrm{CAT}(K^{\mathrm{op}}, \mathbf{Set})$
          has a left adjoint $X$ and totally distributive if there is an $F \dashv X \dashv Y$. The point
          of these talks is to explain why totally distributive categories warrant the
          name, given the orthodoxy of the first two paragraphs, and reach towards a
          characterization of such. By the way, for any small category $S$, $\mathbf{Set}^{S^{\mathrm{op}}}$ is
          totally distributive but $({\mathbf{Set}^S})^{\mathrm{op}}$, while total, is not totally
          distributive.

	Richard Wood, Dalhousie University<br><br>
        Title: <em>Totally Distributive Categories II</em><br>
	<p>
	  Abstract:<br>
          In the first talk I have tried to explain why a locally small category $K$, with
          Yoneda functor $Y:K \to \mathrm{CAT}(K^{\mathrm{op}}, \mathbf{Set})$ and adjunctions
          $F \dashv X \dashv Y$, warrants the
          name "totally distributive category &#8212 TD". Namely: $X$ provides the colimits
          for a totally cocomplete catgory, in the sense of Street and Walters; $F(\dashv X)$
          ensures that $K$ has the limits of a cototally complete category; and $(F\dashv)X$ tells
          us that the provider of total colimits preserves cototal limits. The theory of
          monads suggests it is correct to say that such $K$ are those for which cototal
          limits distribute over total colimits. In this talk I want to report on efforts
          to characterize such $K$. <br><br>

          I think it is clear that totality challenges the orthodoxy of which [co]limits
          really merit the name "small [co]limits". The characterization of TD categories
          challenges the orthodoxy of which category-like structures also merit the
          adjective "small". Koslowski introduced a category-like structure, known as a
          "taxon". A taxon ${\bf T}$ admits a hat construction for which $\hat{\bf T}$ is a
          category. Several years ago, I showed that every TD $K$ gives rise to a locally
          small taxon, $\tilde{K}$, for which there is an equivalence $K \Rightarrow \hat{\tilde{K}}$.
          Now since $K$ is locally small, $\hat{\tilde{K}}$ is locally small. In light of a
          famous result of Freyd and Street, I propose to say that $\tilde{K}$ is "Freyd/
          Street small". Yet, the set of objects of $\tilde{K}$ is the set of objects of $K$.
          Rather surprisingly, Freyd/Street smallness appears to be a notion  of
          smallness that allows one to prove the sort of results that one expects for
          small category-like stuctures, directly, &#8212 without reference to the size of
          the set of objects.
