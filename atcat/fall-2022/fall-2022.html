             Title: Pseudocolimits of filtered diagrams of internal categories<br><br>
             Abstract:<br>
             Pseudocolimits are formal gluing constructions used to combine objects
             in a category that are indexed by a pseudofunctor. When the objects
             are categories and the domain of the pseudofunctor is a small filtered
             category it is known from Exercise 6.6 of Exposé 6 of SGA4 that the
             pseudocolimit can be computed by taking the Grothendieck construction
             of the pseudofunctor and then inverting the class of cartesian arrows
             with respect to the canonical fibration. In my masters thesis I described a
             set of conditions on an ambient category E for constructing an internal
             Grothendieck construction and another set of conditions on E along
             with conditions on an internal category, ℂ, in Cat(E) and a map
             w : W → ℂ₁ that allow us to translate the axioms for a category of
             (right) fractions, and construct an internal category of (right)
             fractions. These can be combined in a suitable context to compute the
             pseudocolimit of a (filtered) diagram of internal categories.

             Title: Applications to two reflectors to the ring C1<br><br>
             Abstract: <br>
             This is a progress report on joint work with Walter Burgess of the University
of Ottawa.<br><br>

             We procede from work with Barr and Kennison which appeared in TAC 30(2015)
             229-304. I will resume this work which concerns embedding a subcategory of
             rings into a complete one.<br><br>

             The ring C1 of continuously differentiable functions from the reals to the
             reals is not complete for the two instances that interest us. Thus we seek the
             completions of C1. This leads us into questions in analysis for which we have
             progress but lack definitive answers to date.

             Title: Structured objects in categories of relations<br><br>
             Abstract:<br>
             We will look at several examples of biproduct dagger
             compact closed categories, which are also known as
             strongly compact closed categories with biproducts. Such
             a category is a dagger category that is equipped with two
             symmetric monoidal structures $\oplus$ and $\otimes$,
             where $\oplus$ is a biproduct and $\otimes$ has dual
             objects. A biproduct dagger compact closed category is
             automatically enriched over commutative monoids. In some
             natural examples, these monoids are cancellative, but in
             other natural examples they are idempotent. This talk
             will focus on the latter class.<br><br>

             Specifically, we will look at several examples of
             biproduct dagger compact closed categories that are
             enriched over the category of bounded lattices and
             join-homomorphisms. We will define poset objects and
             group objects in this setting, recovering a number of
             familiar examples including discrete quantum
             groups. Thus, the last part of this talk will focus on
             the category of quantum sets and their binary relations.

             Title: The Double Category of Abelian Groups<br><br>
             Abstract: <br>
             What, indeed, is THE double category of Abelian groups? 
             There is ample empirical evidence that THE double category
             of sets has functions and spans as arrows, THE double category
             of categories functors and profunctors, and perhaps to a lesser
             extent, THE double category of rings homomorphisms and 
             bimodules, but there doesn’t seem to be an obvious choice 
             for THE double category of Abelian groups. Yet, Ab was the 
             base category for almost all of category theory for the first 25 years 
             of the subject and has seen a resurgence in recent years.<br><br>

             In this talk I will interview some of the main candidates, evaluate 
             their qualifications and see if they work well with others, with the
             view of nominating one for the position of “Double Category of 
             Abelian Groups".

             Title: Cartesian Equipments for Data Manipulation<br><br>
             Abstract: <br>
             The aim of this talk is to illustrate how double
             categories and in particular cartesian equipments provide
             a framework for databases, knowledge representation, and
             data manipulation. This work combines the functional
             approach developed by Robert Kent and David Spivak with
             the relational and bicategorical approach of Evan
             Patterson.

             Title: A biset-enriched categorical model for Proto-Quipper with dynamic lifting<br><br>
             Abstract: <br>
             Quipper and Proto-Quipper are a family of quantum
             programming languages that, by their nature as circuit
             description languages, involve two runtimes: one at which
             the program generates a circuit and one at which the
             circuit is executed, normally with probabilistic results
             due to measurements. Accordingly, the language
             distinguishes two kinds of data: parameters, which are
             known at circuit generation time, and states, which are
             known at circuit execution time. Sometimes, it is
             desirable for the results of measurements to control the
             generation of the next part of the circuit. Therefore,
             the language needs to turn states, such as measurement
             outcomes, into parameters, an operation we
             call <em>dynamic lifting</em>.<br> <br>

             In this talk, I will first sketch a $\textit{biset}$-enriched category
             $\overline{\mathbf{C}}$ that can model
             many aspects of Proto-Quipper. If time permits, I will
             also talk about how to refine $\overline{\mathbf{C}}$ so
             that we have an interpretation for dynamic lifting.
             <br><br> This is a joint work with Kohei Kishida, Neil J. Ross
             and Peter Selinger.

             Title: 3-qubit Clifford+CS Operators is an amalgamated product of two finite groups<br><br>
             Abstract: <br>
             This is a work in progress. We found a finite
             presentation of the group G of 3-qubit Clifford+CS operators in terms
             of generators and relations. A corollary is that G is an amalgamated
             product. The proof is easy &#8212 applying a known method to a known
             result. The calculation is non-trivial, which involves simplifying
             hundreds of long equations. Our main contribution is the
             simplification method. Its idea is factoring a group into a product of
             cosets, in other words, finding a "nice" tower of group extensions
             starting from the trivial group to the group in focus.  The ongoing
             part is to check our result in proof assistant Agda.

             Title: Formal methods for quantum programming languages<br><br>
             Abstract: <br>
             In this talk, I would like to discuss the semantics of a quantum
             programming language called Proto-Quipper-L. The language formalizes a
             quantum circuit description language with dynamic lifting, or
             measurement, which allows us to use the quantum measurement inside the
             computation. This work has some limitations while providing new
             questions. For the second part of the talk, I wish to briefly summarize
             some thoughts on an on-going project on semantics of dependent type
             systems for quantum computation.

             Title: Catalytic embeddings: theory and applications<br><br>
             Abstract: <br>
             Let $C$ be a quantum circuit and let $G$ be a set of quantum gates. A
             catalytic embedding of $C$ over $G$ is a pair $(D,v)$ consisting of a state
             $v$ and a circuit $D$ over $G$ such that for every state $u$ we have <br><br>

             $D(u \otimes v) = (Cu) \otimes v$. <br><br>

             Because the state $v$ is left unchanged by the application of $D$, it is
             known as a catalyst. Catalytic embeddings are useful when the circuit
             $C$ cannot be exactly represented over the gate set $G$. In such cases,
             one can leverage the catalyst to implement (any number of occurrences
             of) $C$ using circuits over $G$.<br><br>

             In this talk, I will present the theory of catalytic embeddings and
             discuss applications to the exact and approximate synthesis of quantum
             circuits.

             Title: Visualize fault-tolerant CSS codes using ZX calculus<br><br>
             Abstract:<br>
             How to correctly exchange messages in a noisy room? In a
             quantum system, the information storage unit (aka qubit)
             is incredibly sensitive to interference. As a result,
             quantum information gets degraded. To this end, quantum
             error correcting codes (QECC) and stabilizer theory were
             developed to make large-scale quantum computation
             practical. CSS codes are a special type of stabilizer
             codes constructed from classical codes, yielding
             substantial benefits for QECC developments. <br><br>

             As an intuitive graphical language for quantum computation,
             ZX-calculus can be formulated as a category of natural numbers with
             addition as a monoidal structure. It consists of ZX diagrams (string
             diagrams to represent any linear map, i.e., $(2^n)*(2^m)$ complex
             matrix) and a set of rewrite rules. In recent years, researchers
             started to study how stabilizer theory and ZX-calculus are related. By
             examining QECC through the lens of ZX, we wish to answer a more
             generic question about QECC construction and its fault-tolerant
             implementations. In 2022, Kissinger provided a recipe to visualize the
             encoder for any CSS codes using ZX.<br><br>

             In this talk, I will present our ongoing research efforts to visualize
             fault-tolerant CSS codes. We generalized Kissinger’s recipe to find a
             physical implementation for any logical operations in CSS codes, and
             provided a ZX solution to circumvent the no-go on transversal gates.
